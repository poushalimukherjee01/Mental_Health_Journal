🏗️ How It Works

MindJournal follows a strict Local-Loop Architecture:

Input: User writes in the Journal tab

Tokenization: Text is analyzed using local linguistic markers

Inference: Emotional weight is evaluated via offline logic

UI Update: Emoji, mood label, and stress level update in real time

Safety Check: High-distress signals immediately trigger the emergency support UI

No data ever leaves the device at any stage.

🛡️ Privacy Manifesto

Most mental health apps monetize emotional data. MindJournal does the opposite.

No Internet Needed: Works in airplane mode

Your Data, Your Device: Clear extension data to erase all history

Your thoughts belong to you — not advertisers, not servers, not algorithms.
